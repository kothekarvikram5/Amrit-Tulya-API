# Amrit-Tulya-API
This is an API for SadGuru's Amrit Tulya - Tea Shop. 

It is built in .Net Core 3.1. This API is used to fetch/add/delete items from the Tea Inventory. 

This API uses EF Core as its ORM and MS SQL-Server for performing Database related operations.

Also, xUnit has been used for implementing unit tests.

This API is locally hosted on port 3000.

## Deployment

In the above path, you will find the published code for Windows OS, which you can directly deploy.

To configure this for others environments, again need to configure from the code.
